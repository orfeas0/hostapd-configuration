# Connecting to WIFI and sharing on the same NIC

This script uses **wpa_supplicant** to connect to a WPA2 wifi, and shares it on 
the same NIC using **hostapd**.

## How to use

```
# Install 
./install.sh

# Connect to the AP
./connect.sh wpa_supplicant.sh

# Start hostapd to share the internet access
./start

# Stop when finished
./stop
```
